Amazing value for the price!",N/A,"Pros-Picture quality is excellent, supports HDR and Dolby Atmos.The UI is super fast and lag free.Google TV is great and easy to use.Speakers are very loud for inbuilt TV speakers.Cons-Upscaling for lower resolution content could be better.Overall it's a great value for money product especiallyif you get it for within 30k.

Got Faulty TV and wrong publicity by amazon as OLED tv",N/A,"I got faulty TV, IR receiver inside TV didn‚Äôt responded. I need to raise warranty service request but they responded with worst solutions, later they assigned technicians to fix it. Technician contacted me by saying that I need to pay him 450INR to come to my home and fix it. I asked him, why i need to pay when its under warranty, but he denied saying that TV company will give them only 150INR to do the job, which will not cover my petrol costs also. Then he warned me saying that if i am interested for that price he will come to do service else leave. I contacted customer care and reported the issue with Technician, they said he should not take any money, and from their side they also escalated the issue. No reply from anyone, so i contacted technician again and said will see after the job done about money, first visit. He came and tried to do something with remote but no use. So he left that day saying he will be back again. After 2 days he came and opened TV , there we can see clearly that IR receiver cable is not connected to board. Its simply a assembly issue in manufacturing. He just clipped it, it worked. He asked for 750rs , then i asked it its under warranty right why i need to pay but he denied. Then he argued a lot and took money.Such a  Worst customer care by TCL.One more thing is that Amazon misleading or miscommunication about the product, by displaying it as OLED Tv . I thought its OLED and purchased but its not Oled tv. I got cheated by amazon

Nice tv at budget price",N/A,"The media could not be loaded.
                



I about to purchase C61B Tv but, due to out of stock forcebly I purchased this model.The Main reason to avoid  this  is, it will come 16gb internal where as c61b comes 32gbAnd this model  stereo speakers where as c61b is 2.1 onkyo speakers.But to be my surprise.This model also having onkyo 2.1 speakers inbuilt.Very nice audio and video quality.Worth for money.Only my observation is table top will give super audio quality compare to wall mount.the main reason woofer is fitted between rectangular fixed wall mount.Finally iam so happy.
