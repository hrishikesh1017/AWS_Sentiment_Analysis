Must needed product in home",N/A,"I have been  using the Insta Cuppa Non-Stick Multi Cooking Pot/Kettle for a few weeks now, and I'm thoroughly impressed! It's incredibly versatile, allowing me to boil water, cook noodles, and even make soups effortlessly. The non-stick surface is a game-changer; cleaning up is a breeze with no stubborn food residues left behind. The design is sleek and modern, fitting perfectly in my kitchen without taking up much space. Plus, the build quality feels robust and durable. Overall, it's exceeded my expectations and has become an essential part of my daily cooking routine. Highly recommended!"""

Very short Two pin Power cable",N/A,"The media could not be loaded.
                



Ordered this for travel cooking ( in the train/ car etc.) it's very light weight so it can be easily carried out.Used it for the first time today.The power cable needs a bit of wiggling to get power on the wall socket end. ( 2 pin tops are notoriously known for loose connections)Only half hemisphere heat is coming. Took 7 minutes for 1 cup water to come to a rolling boil, didn't auto shutdown.Build is nice, the lid and handle feel good.Aesthetics are nice, the coffee mug type handle is the cherry on top.Since it's not performing as expected I'm ordering a replacement, will update post replacement."

Convenient, but could be better",N/A,"The electric Kettle is ideal for a single person to cook a fuss free quick meal and is an ideal companion on the road.  My grouse is with the short electric cable with 2 pin. My kitchen has 3 pin electric plug points and they do not suit the 2 pin plug provided with the kettle. That's an inconvenience. Barring that, the product looks cute, small and built sturdy."
Dinesh S Chawla,4.0,"4.0 out of 5 stars
Good product for Travel",N/A,"We are delighted to have this product with us, during our journey. It helps us prepare food for our little one. Light weight product with good performance, auto switch off is not available. Has very minimal noise. Speed is average.3 improvements can be made:1. The cable / cord can be longer for easy access2. The heating / boiling mechanism can be evenly distributed across the bottom of the product3. The steam out hole on the lid can be a bit larger or few more holes can be attached for easy boiling of rice and other items."
kumar,4.0,"4.0 out of 5 stars
Good product",N/A,"I bought this product for my baby, so that cook food during when we are out of city. Its delivers as promised. But person has to be patient as it takes time for food to cook unlike a regular gas stove. Only one negative that I see is that you can heat milk but u cannot boil it which is necessary for babies . Waited for almost 30mins but was unable to boil milk. Anyways i would still say it's a good product as it helped us in lot of things like steaming veggies , heating water and reheating milk ...it's a good to have product during travel with babies."
